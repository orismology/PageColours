# Piwik PageColours Plugin

## Description

Replaces the rainbow of colourful folder icons in Piwik's "Visitors in Real-time" widget with colourful folder icons that match user-defined url patterns.

Very experimental.

## FAQ

__Should I Use This?__
Probably not, or at least, not yet. 

It's very experimental, very clobbered together, and probably full of bugs. It doesn't sanitise input, writes directly to the filesystem, and probably has a bunch of security holes.

Eventually, this should evolve to the point where it is stable and easy to use, but right now you use it at your own risk. It *shouldn't* break anything, but I can't guarantee that.


## Changelog

0.1.0 First Version

## Support

Please direct any feedback to @orismology on twitter, or create an issue in the orismology/PageColours repo. I can't promise much support, this was cobbled together in a weekend by someone who knew literally nothing about Piwik plugins (and, to be honest, still doesn't).
